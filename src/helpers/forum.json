I’m posting here with the hope that this reaches the relevant parties.\n\nAs it stands, Gauntlet currently has two addresses that have UNI delegated to it:\nEOA: 0x6626593C237f530D15aE9980A95ef938Ac15c35c 5\nMulti-Sig: 0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02 4\n\nWe’re in the process of consolidating all delegations to one address (multi-sig). If you are currently delegating to the EOA, we are asking you to re-delegate to the multi-sig address.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me here or on Twitter (@mattdobel, @gauntletnetwork).\n\nThanks for your support.",
